<h1>13 Foods That Could Lower Your Risk of Cancer </h1>
<p>
<br>
What you eat can drastically affect many aspects of your health,
 including your risk of developing chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes and cancer.
 <br>
 <br>


The development of cancer, in particular, has been shown to be heavily
 influenced by your diet.
 <br>
 <br>


Many foods contain beneficial compounds that could help decrease
 the growth of cancer.
 <br>
 <br>

There are also several studies showing that a higher intake 
of certain foods could be associated with a lower risk of the disease.
<br>
<br>


This article will delve into the research and look at 13 foods that
 may lower your risk of cancer.
 <br>
 <br>

<b> 1. Broccoli </b>
Broccoli contains sulforaphane, a plant compound found in cruciferous
 vegetables that may have potent anticancer properties.
 <br>
 <br>


One test-tube study showed that sulforaphane reduced the 
size and number of breast cancer cells by up to 75% (1Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


Similarly, an animal study found that treating mice with
 sulforaphane helped kill off prostate cancer cells and 
 reduced tumor volume by more than 50% (2Trusted Source).
 <br>
 <br>


Some studies have also found that a higher intake of
 cruciferous vegetables like broccoli may be linked to a lower risk of colorectal cancer.
 <br>
 <br>


One analysis of 35 studies showed that eating more cruciferous
 vegetables was associated with a lower risk of colorectal and
  colon cancer (3Trusted Source).
  <br>
  <br>

Including broccoli with a few meals per week may come with
 some cancer-fighting benefits.
 <br>
 <br>


However, keep in mind that the available research hasn’t 
looked directly at how broccoli may affect cancer in humans.
<br>
<br>


Instead, it has been limited to test-tube, animal and 
observational studies that either investigated the effects
 of cruciferous vegetables, or the effects of a specific
  compound in broccoli. Thus, more studies are needed.
  <br>
  <br>

<b> 2. Carrot </b>
Several studies have found that eating more carrots is
 linked to a decreased risk of certain types of cancer.
 <br>
 <br>


For example, an analysis looked at the results of five 
studies and concluded that eating carrots may reduce the 
risk of stomach cancer by up to 26% (4Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


Another study found that a higher intake of carrots was 
associated with 18% lower odds of developing prostate cancer (5Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


One study analyzed the diets of 1,266 participants with 
and without lung cancer. It found that current smokers who
 did not eat carrots were three times as likely to develop
  lung cancer, compared to those who ate carrots more than 
  once per week (6Trusted Source).
  <br>
  <br>


Try incorporating carrots into your diet as a healthy snack
 or delicious side dish just a few times per week to increase
  your intake and potentially reduce your risk of cancer.
  <br>
  <br>


Still, remember that these studies show an association 
between carrot consumption and cancer, but don’t account
 for other factors that may play a role.
 <br>
 <br>

<b>3. Beans </b>
<br>
<br>
Beans are high in fiber, which some studies have
 found may help protect against colorectal cancer 
 (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).
 <br>
 <br>


One study followed 1,905 people with a history of 
colorectal tumors, and found that those who consumed
 more cooked, dried beans tended to have a decreased 
 risk of tumor recurrence (10Trusted Source).
 <br>
 <br>


An animal study also found that feeding rats black 
beans or navy beans and then inducing colon cancer 
blocked the development of cancer cells by up to 75% (11Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


According to these results, eating a few servings
 of beans each week may increase your fiber intake
  and help lower the risk of developing cancer.
  <br>
  <br>


However, the current research is limited to animal 
studies and studies that show association but not 
causation. More studies are needed to examine this in humans, specifically.
<br>
<br>

<b> 4. Berries </b>
<br>
<br>
Berries are high in anthocyanins, plant pigments that have
 antioxidant properties and may be associated with a reduced risk of cancer.
 <br>
 <br>


In one human study, 25 people with colorectal cancer were treated
 with bilberry extract for seven days, which was found to reduce 
 the growth of cancer cells by 7% (12Trusted Source).
 <br>
 <br>


Another small study gave freeze-dried black raspberries
 to patients with oral cancer and showed that it decreased
  levels of certain markers associated with cancer progression (13Trusted Source).
  <br>
  <br>


One animal study found that giving rats freeze-dried black raspberries
 reduced esophageal tumor incidence by up to 54% and decreased the
  number of tumors by up to 62% (14Trusted Source).
  <br>
  <br>


Similarly, another animal study showed that giving rats a
 berry extract was found to inhibit several biomarkers of cancer (15Trusted Source).
 <br>
 <br>


Based on these findings, including a serving or two of berries 
in your diet each day may help inhibit the development of cancer.
<br>
<br>


Keep in mind that these are animal and observational studies 
looking at the effects of a concentrated dose of berry extract, 
and more human research is needed.
<br>
<br>

<b>5. Cinnamon </b>
<br>
<br>
Cinnamon is well-known for its health benefits, including
 its ability to reduce blood sugar and ease inflammation
  (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source).
  <br>
  <br>

In addition, some test-tube and animal studies have 
found that cinnamon may help block the spread of cancer cells.
<br>
<br>


A test-tube study found that cinnamon extract was able 
to decrease the spread of cancer cells and induce their death (18Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


Another test-tube study showed that cinnamon essential oil suppressed 
the growth of head and neck cancer cells, and also significantly
 reduced tumor size (19Trusted Source).
 <br>
 <br>


An animal study also showed that cinnamon extract induced 
cell death in tumor cells, and also decreased how much 
tumors grew and spread (20Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


Including 1/2–1 teaspoon (2–4 grams) of cinnamon in
 your diet per day may be beneficial in cancer 
 prevention, and may come with other benefits as well, such 
 as reduced blood sugar and decreased inflammation.
 <br>
<br>


However, more studies are needed to understand how
 cinnamon may affect cancer development in human
 <br>
 <br>

<b> 6. Nuts </b>
Research has found that eating nuts may be linked to a lower risk of certain types of cancer.<br>
<Br>


For instance, a study looked at the diets of 19,386 people and found 
that eating a greater amount of nuts was associated with a decreased
 risk of dying from cancer (21Trusted Source).
 <br>
 <br>


Another study followed 30,708 participants for up to 30 years 
and found that eating nuts regularly was associated with a decreased
 risk of colorectal, pancreatic and endometrial cancers (22Trusted Source).
 <br>
 <br>


Other studies have found that specific types of nuts may be linked 
to a lower cancer risk.
<br>
<br>

For example, Brazil nuts are high in selenium, which may help
 protect against lung cancer in those with a low selenium status (23Trusted Source).
 <br>
 <br>


Similarly, one animal study showed that feeding mice walnuts 
decreased the growth rate of breast cancer cells by 80% and 
reduced the number of tumors by 60% (24Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


These results suggest that adding a serving of nuts to your 
diet each day may reduce your risk of developing cancer in the future.
<br>
<br>


Still, more studies in humans are needed to determine whether 
nuts are responsible for this association, or whether other factors are involved.
<br>
<br>
<b> 7. OLive oil </b>
Olive oil is loaded with health benefits, so it’s no wonder it’s
 one of the staples of the Mediterranean diet.
 <br>
 <br>


Several studies have even found that a higher intake
 of olive oil may help protect against cancer.
 <br>
 <br>


One massive review made up of 19 studies showed that people 
who consumed the greatest amount of olive oil had a lower 
risk of developing breast cancer and cancer of the digestive 
system than those with the lowest intake (25Trusted Source).

<br>
<br>

Another study looked at the cancer rates in 28 countries
 around the world and found that areas with a higher intake
  of olive oil had decreased rates of colorectal cancer (26Trusted Source).
  <br>
  <br>


Swapping out other oils in your diet for olive oil is a 
simple way to take advantage of its health benefits. You 
can drizzle it over salads and cooked vegetables, or try 
using it in your marinades for meat, fish or poultry.
<br>
<br>


Though these studies show that there may be an association 
between olive oil intake and cancer, there are likely other
 factors involved as well. More studies are needed to look
  at the direct effects of olive oil on cancer in people.
  <br>
  <br>

<b>8. Turmeric </b>
Turmeric is a spice well-known for its health-promoting properties.
 Curcumin, its active ingredient, is a chemical with anti-inflammatory,
  antioxidant and even anticancer effects.
  <br>
  <br>


One study looked at the effects of curcumin on 44 patients with 
lesions in the colon that could have become cancerous. After 30 
days, 4 grams of curcumin daily reduced the number of lesions
 present by 40% (27Trusted Source).
 <br>
 <br>



In a test-tube study, curcumin was also found to decrease 
the spread of colon cancer cells by targeting a specific 
enzyme related to cancer growth (28Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


Another test-tube study showed that curcumin helped kill 
off head and neck cancer cells (29Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


Curcumin has also been shown to be effective in slowing the
 growth of lung, breast and prostate cancer cells in other
  test-tube studies (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source).
  <br>
  <br>


For the best results, aim for at least 1/2–3 teaspoons 
(1–3 grams) of ground turmeric per day. Use it as a ground spice to
 add flavor to foods, and pair it with black pepper to help boost its absorption.
 <br>
 <br>

<b>9. Citrus fruits </b>
<br>
<br>
Eating citrus fruits such as lemons, limes, grapefruits
 and oranges has been associated with a lower risk of cancer in some studies.
 <br>
 <br>


One large study found that participants who ate a higher
 amount of citrus fruits had a lower risk of developing
 cancers of the digestive and upper respiratory tracts (33Trusted Source).
 <br>
 <br>


A review looking at nine studies also found that a greater 
intake of citrus fruits was linked to a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (34Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


Finally, a review of 14 studies showed that a high intake,
 or at least three servings per week, of citrus fruit reduced
  the risk of stomach cancer by 28% (35Trusted Source).
  <br>
  <br>


These studies suggest that including a few servings of citrus
 fruits in your diet each week may lower your risk of developing certain types of cancer.
 <br>
 <br>


Keep in mind that these studies don’t account for other factors
 that may be involved. More studies are needed on how citrus 
 fruits specifically affect cancer development.
 <br>

<b>10. Flax seed </b>
<br>
<br>

High in fiber as well as heart-healthy fats, flaxseed
 can be a healthy addition to your diet.
 <br>
 <br>


Some research has shown that it may even help decrease 
cancer growth and help kill off cancer cells.
<br>
<br>


In one study, 32 women with breast cancer received 
either a flaxseed muffin daily or a placebo for over a month.
<br>
<br>


At the end of the study, the flaxseed group had decreased
 levels of specific markers that measure tumor growth, as
  well as an increase in cancer cell death (36Trusted Source).
  <br>
  <br>


In another study, 161 men with prostate cancer were treated 
with flaxseed, which was found to reduce the growth and spread 
of cancer cells (37Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


Flaxseed is high in fiber, which other studies have 
found to be protective against colorectal cancer (7Trusted Source, 
8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


Try adding one tablespoon (10 grams) of ground flaxseed
 into your diet each day by mixing it into smoothies,
  sprinkling it over cereal and yogurt, or adding it to your favorite baked goods
  <br>
  <br>

<b>11. Tomatoes </b>
<br>
<br>
Lycopene is a compound found in tomatoes that is responsible
 for its vibrant red color as well as its anticancer properties.
 <br>
 <br>


Several studies have found that an increased intake of lycopene 
and tomatoes could lead to a reduced risk of prostate cancer.
<br>
<br>


A review of 17 studies also found that a higher intake of raw
 tomatoes, cooked tomatoes and lycopene were all associated with
  a reduced risk of prostate cancer (38Trusted Source).
  <br>
  <br>


Another study of 47,365 people found that a greater intake 
of tomato sauce, in particular, was linked to a lower risk
 of developing prostate cancer (39Trusted Source).
 <br>
 <br>


To help increase your intake, include a serving or two
 of tomatoes in your diet each day by adding them to sandwiches,
  salads, sauces or pasta dishes.
  <br>
  <br>


Still, remember that these studies show there may be an 
association between eating tomatoes and a reduced risk 
of prostate cancer, but they don’t account for other factors that could be involved.
<br>
<br>
<b> 12. Garlic </b>
<br>
<br>

The active component in garlic is allicin, a compound that has been
 shown to kill off cancer cells in multiple test-tube studies
  (40Trusted Source, 41Trusted Source, 42Trusted Source).
  <br>
  <br>


Several studies have found an association between garlic intake
 and a lower risk of certain types of cancer.
 <br>
 <br>


One study of 543,220 participants found that those who ate
 lots of Allium vegetables, such as garlic, onions, leeks 
 and shallots, had a lower risk of stomach cancer than those 
 who rarely consumed them (43Trusted Source).
 <br>
 <br>


A study of 471 men showed that a higher intake of garlic
 was associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer (44Trusted Source).
 <br>
 <br>


Another study found that participants who ate lots of garlic, as well as 
fruit, deep yellow vegetables, dark green vegetables and onions, were 
less likely to develop colorectal tumors. However, this study did not 
isolate the effects of garlic (45Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


Based on these findings, including 2–5 grams (approximately one clove)
 of fresh garlic into your diet per day can help you take advantage
  of its health-promoting properties.

<br>
<br>

However, despite the promising results showing an association 
between garlic and a reduced risk of cancer, more studies are 
needed to examine whether other factors play a role.
<br>
<br>

<b>13. Fatty fish </b>
<br>
<br>
Some research suggests that including a few servings of fish in 
your diet each week may reduce your risk of cancer.
<br>
<br>


One large study showed that a higher intake of fish was associated 
with a lower risk of digestive tract cancer (46Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


Another study that followed 478,040 adults found that eating 
more fish decreased the risk of developing colorectal cancer,
 while red and processed meats actually increased the risk (47Trusted Source).
 <br>
 <br>


In particular, fatty fish like salmon, mackerel and anchovies 
contain important nutrients such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty
 acids that have been linked to a lower risk of cancer.
 <br>
 <br>


For example, having adequate levels of vitamin D is 
believed to protect against and reduce the risk of cancer (48Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


In addition, omega-3 fatty acids are thought to block the 
development of the disease (49Trusted Source).
<br>
<br>


Aim for two servings of fatty fish per week to get a
 hearty dose of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, and 
 to maximize the potential health benefits of these nutrients.
 <br>
 <br>


Still, more research is needed to determine how fatty fish
 consumption may directly influence the risk of cancer in humans.
