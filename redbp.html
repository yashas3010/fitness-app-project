<h1> Everything You Need to Know About High Blood Pressure </h1>
<h4>What is High blood pressure </h4> 
<p>
<br>
High blood pressure, or hypertension, occurs when
 your blood pressure increases to unhealthy levels.
  Your blood pressure measurement takes into account 
  how much blood is passing through your blood vessels
   and the amount of resistance the blood meets while 
   the heart is pumping.
   <br>
   <br>


Narrow arteries increase resistance. The narrower
 your arteries are, the higher your blood pressure
  will be. Over the long term, increased pressure
   can cause health issues, including heart disease.
   <br>
   <br>


Hypertension is quite common. In fact, since the
 guidelines have recently changed, it’s expected 
 that nearly half of American adults will now be diagnosed with this condition.
 <br>
 <br>


Hypertension typically develops over the course of several
 years. Usually, you don’t notice any symptoms. But even
  without symptoms, high blood pressure can cause damage
   to your blood vessels and organs, especially the brain,
    heart, eyes, and kidneys.
    <br>
    <br>


Early detection is important. Regular blood pressure
 readings can help you and your doctor notice any changes.
  If your blood pressure is elevated, your doctor may 
  have you check your blood pressure over a few weeks
   to see if the number stays elevated or falls back to normal levels.
   <br>
   <br>


Treatment for hypertension includes both prescription 
medication and healthy lifestyle changes. If the condition 
isn’t treated, it could lead to health issues, including heart attack and stroke.
<br>
<br>


</p>

<h1>What is the symptoms of High pressure ?</h1> 
<p>
<br>
Hypertension is generally a silent condition.
 Many people won’t experience any symptoms. It 
 may take years or even decades for the condition 
 to reach levels severe enough that symptoms
  become obvious. Even then, these symptoms may be attributed to other issues.
  <br>
  <br>


Symptoms of severe hypertension can include:
<br>
<br>


1. headaches<br>
2. shortness of breath<br>
3. nosebleeds<br>
4. flushing<br>
5. dizziness<br>
6. chest pain<br>
7. visual changes<br>
8. blood in the urine<br>
<br>

These symptoms require immediate medical attention.
 They don’t occur in everyone with hypertension, but 
 waiting for a symptom of this condition to appear could be fatal.
 <br>
 <br>


The best way to know if you have hypertension is to get
 regular blood pressure readings. Most doctors’ offices
  take a blood pressure reading at every appointment.
  <br>
  <br>


If you only have a yearly physical, talk to your doctor
 about your risks for hypertension and other readings you 
 may need to help you watch your blood pressure.
 <br>
 <br>


For example, if you have a family history of heart disease
 or have risk factors for developing the condition, your 
 doctor may recommend that you have your blood pressure 
 checked twice a year. This helps you and your doctor 
 stay on top of any possible issues before they become problematic.
 <br>
 <br>

</p>

<h1>What causes high blood pressure </h1> 
<p>
<br>
There are two types of hypertension. Each type has a different cause.
<br>
<br>


<b>Primary hypertension</b>
<br>

Primary hypertension is also called essential hypertension. 
This kind of hypertension develops over time with no identifiable cause.
 Most people have this type of high blood pressure.
 <br>
 <br>


Researchers are still unclear what mechanisms cause blood 
pressure to slowly increase. A combination of factors may 
play a role. These factors include:
<br>
<br>


1. <b>Genes:</b> Some people are genetically predisposed to hypertension.
 This may be from gene mutations or genetic abnormalities inherited
  from your parents.
  <br>
2. <b>Physical changes:</b>
If something in your body changes, you may begin experiencing
 issues throughout your body. High blood pressure may be one
  of those issues. For example, it’s thought that changes in
   your kidney function due to aging may upset the body’s 
   natural balance of salts and fluid. This change may cause
    your body’s blood pressure to increase.
<br>
3. <b>Environment:</b> Over time, unhealthy lifestyle choices
 like lack of physical activity and poor diet can
  take their toll on your body. Lifestyle choices 
  can lead to weight problems. Being overweight or 
  obese can increase your risk for hypertension.

  <br>
  <br>

<b>Secondary hypertension</b>
<br>
<br>

Secondary hypertension often occurs quickly and can 

become more severe than primary hypertension. Several
 conditions that may cause secondary hypertension include:
 <br>
 <br>


1. kidney disease<br>
2. obstructive sleep apnea<br>
3. congenital heart defects<br>
4. problems with your thyroid<br>
5. side effects of medications<br>
6. use of illegal drugs<br>
7. alcohol abuse or chronic use<br>
8. adrenal gland problems<br>
9. certain endocrine tumors<br>
<br>

</p>

<h1> Diagonising high blood pressure </h1>
<p>
<br>
Diagnosing hypertension is as simple as taking a
 blood pressure reading. Most doctors’ offices check 
 blood pressure as part of a routine visit. If you don’t
  receive a blood pressure reading at your next appointment, request one
<br>
<br>

If your blood pressure is elevated, your doctor may

 request you have more readings over the course of a
  few days or weeks. A hypertension diagnosis is rarely
   given after just one reading. Your doctor needs to see
    evidence of a sustained problem. That’s because
     your environment can contribute to increased blood
      pressure, such as the stress you may feel by being
       at the doctor’s office. Also, blood pressure levels change throughout the day.
<br>
<br>


If your blood pressure remains high, your doctor will likely
 conduct more tests to rule out underlying conditions. These tests can include:
 <br>
 <br>

1. urine test<br>
2. cholesterol screening and other blood tests<br>
3. test of your heart’s electrical activity with an 
electrocardiogram (EKG, sometimes referred to as an ECG)
<br>
4. ultrasound of your heart or kidneys<br>
5. These tests can help your doctor identify any
 secondary issues causing your elevated blood pressure. 
 They can also look at the effects high blood 
 pressure may have had on your organs.
 <br>

6. During this time, your doctor may begin treating
 your hypertension. Early treatment may reduce your risk of lasting damage.
 <br>

</p>


<h1> How to understand High blood pressure reading  </h1>
<p>
<br>
Two numbers create a blood pressure reading:
<br>


<b>Systolic pressure:</b> This is the first, or top, number. It indicates 
the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats and pumps out blood.
<br>
<b>Diastolic pressure: </b>This is the second, or bottom, number. It’s 
the reading of the pressure in your arteries between beats of your heart.
<br>
<br>

Five categories define blood pressure readings for adults:
<br>


1. <b>Healthy:</b>A healthy blood pressure reading is less than 120/80 
millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).
<br>
2. <b>Elevated:</b>The systolic number is between 120 and 129 mm Hg,
 and the diastolic number is less than 80 mm Hg. Doctors usually don’t 
 treat elevated blood pressure with medication. Instead, your doctor
  may encourage lifestyle changes to help lower your numbers.
<br>
3. <b>Stage 1 hypertension:</b> The systolic number is between 130
 and 139 mm Hg, or the diastolic number is between 80 and 89 mm Hg.
 <br>

4. <b>Stage 2 hypertension: </b>The systolic number is 140 mm Hg 
or higher, or the diastolic number is 90 mm Hg or higher.
<br>

5. <b>Hypertensive crisis:</b> The systolic number is over 180 mm Hg,
 or the diastolic number is over 120 mm Hg. Blood pressure in this
  range requires urgent medical attention. If any symptoms such as
   chest pain, headache, shortness of breath, or visual changes 
   occur when blood pressure is this high, medical care in the emergency room is needed.
   <br>
   <br>

A blood pressure reading is taken with a pressure cuff. 
For an accurate reading, it’s important you have a cuff 
that fits. An ill-fitting cuff may deliver inaccurate readings.
<br>
<br>


Blood pressure readings are different for children and
 teenagers. Ask your child’s doctor for the healthy ranges
 for your child if you’re asked to monitor their blood pressure.

<br>
<br>

</p>

<h1> Treatment option for high blood pressure </h1>
<p>
<br>
A number of factors help your doctor determine the best 
treatment option for you. These factors include which type
 of hypertension you have and what causes have been identified.
 <br>
 <br>


<b>Primary hypertension treatment options

</b>
<br>
<br>
If your doctor diagnoses you with primary hypertension,
 lifestyle changes may help reduce your high blood pressure. 
 If lifestyle changes alone aren’t enough, or if they stop
  being effective, your doctor may prescribe medication.
  <br>
  <br>


<b>Secondary hypertension treatment options </b>
<br>
<br>

If your doctor discovers an underlying issue causing
 your hypertension, treatment will focus on that other
  condition. For example, if a medicine you’ve started 
  taking is causing increased blood pressure, your doctor 
  will try other medicines that don’t have this side effect.
  <br>
  <br>


Sometimes, hypertension is persistent despite treatment 
for the underlying cause. In this case, your doctor may
 work with you to develop lifestyle changes and prescribe
  medications to help reduce your blood pressure.
  <br>
  <br>

Treatment plans for hypertension often evolve. 
What worked at first may become less useful 
over time. Your doctor will continue to work with you to refine your treatment.
<br>
<br>

</p>

<h1>Medication for high blood pressure </h1> 
<p>
<br>
Many people go through a trial-and-error phase
 with blood pressure medications. You may need
  to try different medicines until you find one 
  or a combination of medications that work for you.
  <br>
  <br>

Some of the medications used to treat hypertension include:
<br>


1. <b>Beta-blockers:</b> Beta-blockers make your heart beat slower
 and with less force. This reduces the amount of blood pumped 
 through your arteries with each beat, which lowers blood pressure.
  It also blocks certain hormones in your body that can raise your blood pressure.<br>
2. <b>Diuretics:</b> High sodium levels and excess fluid in your body
 can increase blood pressure. Diuretics, also called water pills, help
  your kidneys remove excess sodium from your body. As the sodium leaves,
   extra fluid in your bloodstream moves into your urine, which helps 
   lower your blood pressure.<br>
3. <b>ACE inhibitors:</b> Angiotensin is a chemical that causes blood 
vessels and artery walls to tighten and narrow. ACE (angiotensin 
converting enzyme) inhibitors prevent the body from producing as
 much of this chemical. This helps blood vessels relax and reduces blood pressure.<br>
4. <b>Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs):</b> While ACE inhibitors aim
 to stop the creation of angiotensin, ARBs block angiotensin from binding
  with receptors. Without the chemical, blood vessels won’t tighten. That
   helps relax vessels and lower blood pressure.<br>

5. <b>Calcium channel blockers: </b> These medications block some 
of the calcium from entering the cardiac muscles of your heart. 
This leads to less forceful heartbeats and a lower blood pressure.
 These medicines also work in the blood vessels, causing them to
  relax and further lowering blood pressure.
  <br>
  
6. <b>Alpha-2 agonists: </b> This type of medication changes the nerve
 impulses that cause blood vessels to tighten. This helps blood vessels
  to relax, which reduces blood pressure.
  <br>
  <br> 

</p>


<h1> Home remedy for high blood pressure </h1>
<p>
<br>
Healthy lifestyle changes can help you control 
the factors that cause hypertension. Here are 
some of the most common home remedies.
<br>
<br>


<b>Developing a healthy diet</b>
<br>
<br>

A heart-healthy diet is vital for helping to reduce high blood pressure.
 It’s also important for managing hypertension that is under control
  and reducing the risk of complications. These complications include
   heart disease, stroke, and heart attack.
   <br>
   <br>

A heart-healthy diet emphasizes foods that include:
<br>


1. fruits<br>
2. vegetables<br>
3. whole grains<br>
4. lean proteins like fish<br>
5. Increasing physical activity<br>
<br>

Reaching a healthy weight should include being more physically
 active. In addition to helping you shed pounds, exercise
  can help reduce stress, lower blood pressure naturally,
   and strengthen your cardiovascular system.
   <br>
   <br>


Aim to get 150 minutes of moderate physical activity
 each week. That’s about 30 minutes five times per week.
 <br>
 <br>


<b>Reaching a healthy weight </b>
<br>
<br>

If you are overweight or obese, losing weight
 through a heart-healthy diet and increased physical 
 activity can help lower your blood pressure.
<br>
<br>


<b>Excercise </b> 
Exercise is a great way to manage stress. 
Other activities can also be helpful. These include:
<br>


1. meditation<br>
2. deep breathing<br>
3. massage<br>
4. muscle relaxation<br>
5. yoga or tai chi<br>
<br>

These are all proven stress-reducing techniques.
 Getting adequate sleep can also help reduce stress levels.
 <br>
 <br>


<b>Adopting a cleaner lifestyle</b>
<br>
<br>

If you’re a smoker, try to quit. The chemicals 
in tobacco smoke damage the body’s tissues and harden blood vessel walls.
<br>
<br>


If you regularly consume too much alcohol or have an 
alcohol dependency, seek help to reduce the amount you 
drink or stop altogether. Alcohol can raise blood pressure.
<br>
<br>

</p>
<h1>Dietert recommendation for people with high blood pressure </h1> 
<p>
<br>
One of the easiest ways you can treat hypertension 
and prevent possible complications is through your 
diet. What you eat can go a long way toward easing
 or eliminating hypertension.
<br>
<br>


Here are some of the most common dietary 
recommendations for people with hypertension.
<br>
<br>


<b>Eat less meat, more plants </b>
<br>
<br>

A plant-based diet is an easy way to increase fiber 
and reduce the amount of sodium and unhealthy saturated
 and trans fat you take in from dairy foods and meat. 
 Increase the number of fruits, vegetables, leafy greens
 , and whole grains you’re eating. Instead of red meat, 
 opt for healthier lean proteins like fish, poultry, or tofu.
 <br>
 <br>


<b>Reduce dietary sodium </b>
<br>
<br>

People with hypertension and those with an increased
 risk for heart disease may need to keep their daily 
 sodium intake between 1,500 milligrams and 2,300 milligrams 
 per day. The best way to reduce sodium is to cook fresh
  foods more often. Avoid eating restaurant food or 
  prepackaged foods, which are often very high in sodium.

  <br>
  <br>

<b>Cut back on sweets </b>
<br>
<br>
Sugary foods and beverages contain empty calories 
but don’t have nutritional content. If you want something sweet, 
try eating fresh fruit or small amounts of dark chocolate
 that haven’t been sweetened as much with sugar. StudiesTrusted 
 Source suggest regularly eating dark chocolate may reduce blood pressure.
 <br>
 <br>

</p>
<h1>What are the effects of high blood pressure on the body? </h1>
<p>
<br>

Because hypertension is often a silent condition, it can cause damage
 to your body for years before symptoms become obvious. 
 If hypertension isn’t treated, you may face serious, even fatal, complications.
 <br>
 <br>


Complications of hypertension include the following.
<br>
<br>

<b>Damaged arteries</b>
<br>
<br>


Healthy arteries are flexible and strong. Blood flows freely 
and unobstructed through healthy arteries and vessels.
<br>
<br>



Hypertension makes arteries tougher, tighter, and less 
elastic. This damage makes it easier for dietary fats
 to deposit in your arteries and restrict blood flow.
  This damage can lead to increased blood pressure, 
  blockages, and, eventually, heart attack and stroke.
  <br>
  <br>

<b>Damaged heart </b>
<br>
<br>

Hypertension makes your heart work too hard.
 The increased pressure in your blood vessels 
 forces your heart’s muscles to pump more frequently
  and with more force than a healthy heart should have to.
  <br>
  <br>


This may cause an enlarged heart. An enlarged heart 
increases your risk for the following:
<br>


1. heart failure<br>
2. arrhythmias<br>
3. sudden cardiac death<br>
4. heart attack<br>
5. Damaged brain<br>
6. Your brain relies on a healthy supply of oxygen-rich blood
 to work properly. High blood pressure can reduce your brain’s supply of blood:
 <br>
 <br>


Temporary blockages of blood flow to the brain are called transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).
<br>
<br>

Significant blockages of blood flow cause brain cells to die. This is known as a stroke.
<br>
<br>

Uncontrolled hypertension may also affect your memory and ability to 
learn, recall, speak, and reason. Treating hypertension often doesn’t
 erase or reverse the effects of uncontrolled hypertension. It
  does, however, lower the risks for future problems.
  <br>
  <br>

</p>
<h1>High blood pressure: Tips for prevention </h1>
<p>
<br>

If you have risk factors for hypertension, you can
 take steps now to lower your risk for the condition and its complications.
 <br>
 <br>


<b>Add healthy foods to your diet </b>
<br>
<br>
Slowly work your way up to eating more servings of heart-healthy plants. 
Aim to eat more than seven servings of fruits and vegetables 
each day. Then aim to add one more serving per day for two weeks
. After those two weeks, aim to add one more serving. The goal 
is to have ten servings of fruits and vegetables per day.
<br>
<br>


<b>Adjust how you think of the average dinner plate </b>
<br>
<br>

Instead of having meat and three sides, create a dish that
 uses meat as a condiment. In other words, instead of eating 
 a steak with a side salad, eat a bigger salad and top it with
  a smaller portion of steak.
  <br>

<b>Cut sugar</b>
<br>
<br>

Try to incorporate fewer sugar-sweetened foods, 
including flavored yogurts, cereals, and sodas.
 Packaged foods hide unnecessary sugar, so be sure to read labels.

<b>Set weight loss goals </b>
<br>
<br>

Instead of an arbitrary goal to “lose weight,” 
talk with your doctor about a healthy weight for
 you. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  (CDC)Trusted Source recommends a weight loss goal of
   one to two pounds a week. That means starting off
    eating 500 calories less per day than what you 
    normally eat. Then decide on what physical activity
     you can start in order to reach that goal. If 
     exercising five nights a week is too hard to work
      into your schedule, aim for one more night than 
      what you’re doing right now. When that fits comfortably
       into your schedule, add another night.

<b>Monitor your blood pressure regularly </b>
<br>

The best way to prevent complications and avoid problems is 
to catch hypertension early. You can come into your doctor’s 
office for a blood pressure reading, or your doctor may ask you
 to purchase a blood pressure cuff and take readings at home.
 <br>
 <br>


Keep a log of your blood pressure readings and take it to
 your regular doctor appointments. This can help your doctor
  see any possible problems before the condition advances.
